**THE HOUSE OF MUSE**

As the name suggests, the accessory brand Muse signifies creative influence and thoughtfulness. The woman today is elegant and powerful. Our accessories are made to enhance the inner beauty of a woman. We believe in making Statement pieces. Our collections are inspired from our travel across the world and gathering the uniqueness scattered all across the globe.

In mythology, the muses were nine goddesses who symbolised the arts and sciences. Today a "Muse" is a person who serves as an artist's inspiration.

Muse is the woman of today and we at The House of Muse want to bring out the best in you.
